            At XPRIZE, I worked on a number of projects. My role here was not
            very design centered and I was mostly focused on front-end
            development in collaboration with other developers.

                This is the marketing site for the organization. Here I worked
                on the UI and designed a few features including the navigation.

                usable code.
