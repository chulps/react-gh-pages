                <p>
                  In Spring 2021, my former colleague from &nbsp;
                  <a href="/clicktool/">Clicktool</a>, Isaac, called me to hang
                  out. He was working at Snapchat and I was at CRI Genetics. We
                  were both sharing stories and telling jokes about our new jobs
                  and things that we've been doing since our time at Clicktool.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Later, while we were eating Korean BBQ, consuming a mountain
                  of grilled meat and banchan, Isaac told me about his project,
                  "Yarden", a little gardening company he started with a friend,
                  and invited me to join the team!

                  This was the logo from when the company was established. As I
                  came here the topic of trademarking this logo was on the table
                  and naturally, I saw an opportunity to make an impact.

                <p>
                  It took some fighting and several hours of meetings... as it
                  should be! Changing your brand after 4 years in business is
                  risky! But I convinced my colleagues to give me a chance...

                <p className="m-none my1">
                  Before I could start on this project I had to figure out what
                  my limitations are. There must be a trace of the old brand but
                  it has to be re-thought to fit the needs of a new brand.

                    1. Make a reference to the imagery and colors from the
                    original Yarden logo. We have to keep the pitchfork and the
                    color green.
                  </small>
                  <small>
                    2. Printed signage is a big part of our marketing so the
                    branding needs to be bold, bright, and readable from a
                    distance.
                  </small>
                  <small>
                    3. It has to work as an app icon for the app store and the
                    iPhone home screen. The mark has to fit well occupy the
                    space of a square or circle very well.
                  </small>
                  <small>4. Use the letter "Y" somehow</small>
                  <small>
                    5. We are gonna trademark this... so it needs to be simple,
                    solid, and timeless.{" "}

            <p className="pt1 pb2">
              In 2023 we decided that our product is in a good place and we want
              to focus more on our marketing. After trying different advertising
              platforms driving traffic to our site, we had to be honest with
              ourselves about a few things...

                  drove to it.

                  We studied our users and found that our site design wasn't
                  helpful at all. Lots of users were simply lost.

              It took us about a 6 months to build and launch the Yarden Mobile

              business facing side for our gardeners and administration, and a

                When we first released the app, we were really proud, this is my
                first ever mobile app. The excitement of finally having an app
                on the app store quickly wears off after we see how it's being
                used.

                    After garden beds are installed, users are left with an app
                    that doesn't do much and a box full of dirt on the ground.
                    We need an abstract way to connect the two things in some
                    way.

                    big presentation.

                    Gardeners also need a way to plan the layout of a garden,
