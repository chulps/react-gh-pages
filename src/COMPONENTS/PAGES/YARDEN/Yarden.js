                  In Spring 2021, my former colleague from &nbsp;
                  <a href="/clicktool/">Clicktool</a>, Isaac, called me to hang
                  out. He was working at Snapchat and I was at CRI Genetics. We
                  were both sharing stories and telling jokes about our new jobs
                  and things that we've been doing since our time at Clicktool.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Later, while we were eating Korean BBQ, consuming a mountain
                  of grilled meat and banchan, Isaac told me about his project,
                  "Yarden", a little gardening company he started with a friend,
                  and invited me to join the team!

                  This was the logo from when the company was established. As I
                  came here the topic of trademarking this logo was on the table
                  and naturally, I saw an opportunity to make an impact.

                  It took some fighting and several hours of meetings... as it
                  should be! Changing your brand after 4 years in business is
                  risky! But I convinced my colleagues to give me a chance...

                  it has to be re-thought to fit the needs of a new brand.
