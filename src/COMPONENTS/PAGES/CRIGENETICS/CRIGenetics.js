              CRI Genetics is a company similar to Ancestry.com or 23andME. I worked primarily on the web app that customers use to interact with the their DNA data. Sometimes I would cross over to the marketing team to help fill in gaps there.

              <p>In Spring 2021, my former colleague from <a href="/clicktool/">Clicktool</a>, Isaac Grey, called me to hang out. At the time, he was working at Snapchat and I was at CRI Genetics. We were both sharing stories and telling jokes about our new jobs and things that we've been doing since our time at Clicktool.</p>
              <p>Later, while we were eating Korean BBQ, consuming a mountain of grilled meat and banchan, Isaac told me about his project, "Yarden", a little gardening company he started with a friend, and invited me to join the team!</p>
