              CRI Genetics is a company similar to Ancestry.com or 23andME. I
              worked primarily on the web app that customers use to interact
              with the their DNA data. Sometimes I would cross over to the
              marketing team to help fill in gaps there.

            <p>I was the only designer in the company.</p>

                In the first quarter of 2020 COVID was getting spicy. I was
                working at <a href="/clicktool">Clicktool</a> and the company
                pivoted from building a marketing analytics product to building
                a politically motivated e-commerce store... which sold
                politically motivated products which I also designed. Ya, I was
                designing products but... not the kind I wanted anything to do
                with.
              </p>
              <p>
                Zip Recruiter has this feature, "1-Click-Apply" which I
                absolutely found a way to abuse. One of the jobs that I blindly
                applied for responded... it was CRI Genetics.

              My new boss wanted to give me a fun new project to welcome me to
              the team. The designer who came before me (who I have much respect
              for) was not a designer who codes but instead, a coder who
              designs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The illustrations in our app were taken from some royalty-free
              images website and my boss wanted something with more personality
              that would more easily help our users connect with the product.
