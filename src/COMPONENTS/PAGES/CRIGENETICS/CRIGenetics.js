              CRI Genetics is a company similar to Ancestry.com or 23andME. I
              worked primarily on the web app that customers use to interact
              with the their DNA data. Sometimes I would cross over to the
              marketing team to help fill in gaps there.

                In the first quarter of 2020 COVID was getting spicy. I was
                working at <a href="/clicktool">Clicktool</a> and the company
                pivoted from building a marketing analytics product to building
                a politically motivated e-commerce store... which sold
                politically motivated products which I also designed. Ya, I was
                designing products but... not the kind I wanted anything to do
                with.

                Zip Recruiter has this feature, "1-Click-Apply" which I
                absolutely found a way to abuse. One of the jobs that I blindly
                applied for responded... it was CRI Genetics.

              My new boss wanted to give me a fun new project to welcome me to
              the team. The designer who came before me (who I have much respect
              for) was not a designer who codes but instead, a coder who
              designs.

              The illustrations in our app were taken from some royalty-free

              that would more easily help our users connect with the product.

                CRI Genetics has a unique approach to genealogical testing. We
                are an advanced team led by a professional molecular geneticist
                who has been studying DNA for over 35 years with the help of
                Nobel Prize winning scientists. At CRI Genetics, we have the
                education, tools, and skills to provide you the most accurate
                estimation of your BioGeographical Ancestry.
              </p>
              <p>
                We combine Genetics with Anthropology to trace the migrations of
                the human race. When we test your DNA against the samples from
                around the globe, we can figure out where you fit in the rich
                history of our species.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our tests examine 642,824 specific markers across your entire
                genome. These markers are hand-picked based on the latest
                breakthroughs and advancements in genetic science. These markers
                are specially chosen for their relevance to tracing ancestry, so
                that we can provide you with the most statistically likely
                estimation of your heritage.
