              CRI Genetics is a company similar to Ancestry.com or 23andME. I
              worked primarily on the web app that customers use to interact
              with the their DNA data. Sometimes I would cross over to the
              marketing team to help fill in gaps there.

                In the first quarter of 2020, COVID was just starting to get serious. I was working at Clicktool and the company had pivoted from a marketing analytics product, to strictly e-commerce. Since I want to build products, I was looking for a role where I could do that.

              <p>Zip Recruiter has this feature, "1-Click-Apply" which I absolutely found a way to abuse. One of the jobs that I blindly applied for responded... it was CRI Genetics.</p>
