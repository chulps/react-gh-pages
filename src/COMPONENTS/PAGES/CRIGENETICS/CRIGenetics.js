              CRI Genetics is a company similar to Ancestry.com or 23andME. I
              worked primarily on the web app that customers use to interact
              with the their DNA data. Sometimes I would cross over to the
              marketing team to help fill in gaps there.

            <p>I was the only designer in the company.</p>

                In the first quarter of 2020 COVID was getting spicy. I was
                working at <a href="/clicktool">Clicktool</a> and the company
                pivoted from building a subscription based marketing analytics
                product to building a Shopify ecommerce site and designing goods
                that I couldn't bring myself to agree with... so I quit.

                Zip Recruiter has this feature, "1-Click-Apply" which I
                absolutely found a way to abuse. One of the jobs that I blindly
                applied for responded... it was CRI Genetics.
