    content: `T-Chat is built on the MERN stack, a powerful combination of MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js. This full-stack TypeScript solution enables fast, scalable, and maintainable web applications. In T-Chat, MongoDB serves as the NoSQL database that stores all user data, chatroom information, and message histories. The backend is powered by Express.js, which handles all API requests, including user authentication, chatroom management, and message processing. React and TypeScript are used on the frontend, providing a modern, efficient, and type-safe environment for developing user interfaces. The use of TypeScript ensures that the code is robust and less prone to errors, while React offers a seamless, component-based architecture that enhances the user experience.`,

    content: `T-Chat integrates several third-party services to enhance its functionality. The Google Cloud Translation API is used for translating text, providing support for over 100 languages. Additionally, Googleâ€™s Language Detection API is used for detecting the language of input text, ensuring that messages are accurately translated based on the detected language. OpenAI's Whisper API is leveraged for real-time voice transcriptions, allowing users to send transcribed messages from spoken language. T-Chat also includes an endpoint for retrieving rich metadata when sharing links, making it easier for users to share and preview web content within chatrooms.`,

    content: `To enhance the development and user experience, T-Chat utilizes a variety of NPM packages. FontAwesome is used for icons, adding a visual appeal to the user interface. Axios is employed for making HTTP requests, allowing seamless interaction with external APIs. Other packages include Express.js for building the server-side logic, Socket.io for real-time communication, and Multer for handling file uploads.`,
