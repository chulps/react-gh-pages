              <h5>Mobile-First Design Preference:</h5>
              The majority of users indicated a preference for mobile devices
              over desktops, especially in contexts like travel and family
              communication. This emphasizes the importance of prioritizing

              <h5>Desire for User-Friendly and Accessible Tools:</h5>
              Users are looking for translation tools that are not only
              functional but also easy to use. Complicated interfaces or tools
              requiring multiple steps to achieve simple translations are a

              <h5>Need for Improved Translation Accuracy:</h5>The accuracy of
              translations, especially in capturing nuances like slang and
              idiomatic expressions, was a significant concern. This highlights
              an opportunity for T-Chat to differentiate itself by offering
              superior translation accuracy that feels natural to both parties
              in a conversation.

              onboarding could make the initial interaction smoother and more
              appealing... maybe it should be optional.
